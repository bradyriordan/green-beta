GreenBeta, a web application built with Ruby on Rails, visualizes carbon data for over 37,000 international firms. Firms can use carbon beta to understand their own carbon risk, regulators to gauge the impact of policy changes, and investors to directly manage carbon risk in their portfolios without hurting performance or preferences.
